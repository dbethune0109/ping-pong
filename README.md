#Ping Pong solo Assignment

 This is week 3 solo assignment. The use of loops and arrays. If the number is divisible by 3, replace it with "ping". If it is divisible by 5, then replace it with "pong". If the number is divisible by 15, then replace it with "pingpong". I started by setting my active directories, HTML, .js, and .css files. I then went through our weeks lessons and expounded upon them by researching online for those terms. I started thinking of the literal sense of the problem, using branching, I had to figure that there was four properties I wanted to make sure were in the array "ping, pong, pingpong and consequencing numbers". Using if, else if was a pretty easy concept starting with  


## Getting Started
To use this program you will need a basic web browser above IE 8, Chrome is what I used to work on it, so it works best.

### Prerequisities

web browser, internet connection

```
Give examples
**This program counts numbers in a list 1-(I tried up to 1000000, it took a while but did it). It replaces 3 with the word "ping", 5 with "pong" and 15 with "pingpong".
 
 In this case  it counts to 2
    
    *ex input:2
    *ex output: 1, 2

 In this case it replaces the number 3 with "ping".
    * ex input: 3
    * ex output: 1, 2 , ping
    
 In this case it replaces 5 with "pong".
    *ex input 5
    *ex output: 1, 2, 3, 4, "pong"
    
 In this case it replaces 15 with "pingpong".
    * ex input: 15
    * ex output: 1,2,ping,4,5,pong,7,8,ping,10,11,ping,13,14,pingpong



Tests:
I ran developer tools and console.log to make sure everything was working.
