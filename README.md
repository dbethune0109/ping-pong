#Ping Pong solo Assignment

 This is week 3 solo assignment. The use of loops and arrays. If the number is divisible by 3, replace it with "ping". If it is divisible by 5, then replace it with "pong". If the number is divisible by 15, then replace it with "pingpong". I started by setting my active directories, HTML, .js, and .css files. I then went through our weeks lessons and expounded upon them by researching online for those terms.
